## Module AWS.IAM.Requests

#### `addClientIDToOpenIDConnectProvider`

``` purescript
addClientIDToOpenIDConnectProvider :: forall eff. Service -> AddClientIDToOpenIDConnectProviderRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Adds a new client ID (also known as audience) to the list of client IDs already registered for the specified IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource.</p> <p>This action is idempotent; it does not fail or return an error if you add an existing client ID to the provider.</p>

#### `addRoleToInstanceProfile`

``` purescript
addRoleToInstanceProfile :: forall eff. Service -> AddRoleToInstanceProfileRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Adds the specified IAM role to the specified instance profile. An instance profile can contain only one role, and this limit cannot be increased.</p> <note> <p>The caller of this API must be granted the <code>PassRole</code> permission on the IAM role by a permission policy.</p> </note> <p>For more information about roles, go to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithRoles.html">Working with Roles</a>. For more information about instance profiles, go to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/AboutInstanceProfiles.html">About Instance Profiles</a>.</p>

#### `addUserToGroup`

``` purescript
addUserToGroup :: forall eff. Service -> AddUserToGroupRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Adds the specified user to the specified group.</p>

#### `attachGroupPolicy`

``` purescript
attachGroupPolicy :: forall eff. Service -> AttachGroupPolicyRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Attaches the specified managed policy to the specified IAM group.</p> <p>You use this API to attach a managed policy to a group. To embed an inline policy in a group, use <a>PutGroupPolicy</a>.</p> <p>For more information about policies, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed Policies and Inline Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

#### `attachRolePolicy`

``` purescript
attachRolePolicy :: forall eff. Service -> AttachRolePolicyRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Attaches the specified managed policy to the specified IAM role. When you attach a managed policy to a role, the managed policy becomes part of the role's permission (access) policy.</p> <note> <p>You cannot use a managed policy as the role's trust policy. The role's trust policy is created at the same time as the role, using <a>CreateRole</a>. You can update a role's trust policy using <a>UpdateAssumeRolePolicy</a>.</p> </note> <p>Use this API to attach a <i>managed</i> policy to a role. To embed an inline policy in a role, use <a>PutRolePolicy</a>. For more information about policies, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed Policies and Inline Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

#### `attachUserPolicy`

``` purescript
attachUserPolicy :: forall eff. Service -> AttachUserPolicyRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Attaches the specified managed policy to the specified user.</p> <p>You use this API to attach a <i>managed</i> policy to a user. To embed an inline policy in a user, use <a>PutUserPolicy</a>.</p> <p>For more information about policies, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed Policies and Inline Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

#### `changePassword`

``` purescript
changePassword :: forall eff. Service -> ChangePasswordRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Changes the password of the IAM user who is calling this action. The root account password is not affected by this action.</p> <p>To change the password for a different user, see <a>UpdateLoginProfile</a>. For more information about modifying passwords, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_ManagingLogins.html">Managing Passwords</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

#### `createAccessKey`

``` purescript
createAccessKey :: forall eff. Service -> CreateAccessKeyRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) CreateAccessKeyResponse
```

<p> Creates a new AWS secret access key and corresponding AWS access key ID for the specified user. The default status for new keys is <code>Active</code>.</p> <p>If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the AWS access key ID signing the request. Because this action works for access keys under the AWS account, you can use this action to manage root credentials even if the AWS account has no associated users.</p> <p> For information about limits on the number of keys you can create, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/LimitationsOnEntities.html">Limitations on IAM Entities</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <important> <p>To ensure the security of your AWS account, the secret access key is accessible only during key and user creation. You must save the key (for example, in a text file) if you want to be able to access it again. If a secret key is lost, you can delete the access keys for the associated user and then create new keys.</p> </important>

#### `createAccountAlias`

``` purescript
createAccountAlias :: forall eff. Service -> CreateAccountAliasRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Creates an alias for your AWS account. For information about using an AWS account alias, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/AccountAlias.html">Using an Alias for Your AWS Account ID</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

#### `createGroup`

``` purescript
createGroup :: forall eff. Service -> CreateGroupRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) CreateGroupResponse
```

<p>Creates a new group.</p> <p> For information about the number of groups you can create, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/LimitationsOnEntities.html">Limitations on IAM Entities</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

#### `createInstanceProfile`

``` purescript
createInstanceProfile :: forall eff. Service -> CreateInstanceProfileRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) CreateInstanceProfileResponse
```

<p> Creates a new instance profile. For information about instance profiles, go to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/AboutInstanceProfiles.html">About Instance Profiles</a>.</p> <p> For information about the number of instance profiles you can create, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/LimitationsOnEntities.html">Limitations on IAM Entities</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

#### `createLoginProfile`

``` purescript
createLoginProfile :: forall eff. Service -> CreateLoginProfileRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) CreateLoginProfileResponse
```

<p> Creates a password for the specified user, giving the user the ability to access AWS services through the AWS Management Console. For more information about managing passwords, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_ManagingLogins.html">Managing Passwords</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

#### `createOpenIDConnectProvider`

``` purescript
createOpenIDConnectProvider :: forall eff. Service -> CreateOpenIDConnectProviderRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) CreateOpenIDConnectProviderResponse
```

<p>Creates an IAM entity to describe an identity provider (IdP) that supports <a href="http://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect (OIDC)</a>.</p> <p>The OIDC provider that you create with this operation can be used as a principal in a role's trust policy to establish a trust relationship between AWS and the OIDC provider.</p> <p>When you create the IAM OIDC provider, you specify the URL of the OIDC identity provider (IdP) to trust, a list of client IDs (also known as audiences) that identify the application or applications that are allowed to authenticate using the OIDC provider, and a list of thumbprints of the server certificate(s) that the IdP uses. You get all of this information from the OIDC IdP that you want to use for access to AWS.</p> <note> <p>Because trust for the OIDC provider is ultimately derived from the IAM provider that this action creates, it is a best practice to limit access to the <a>CreateOpenIDConnectProvider</a> action to highly-privileged users.</p> </note>

#### `createPolicy`

``` purescript
createPolicy :: forall eff. Service -> CreatePolicyRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) CreatePolicyResponse
```

<p>Creates a new managed policy for your AWS account.</p> <p>This operation creates a policy version with a version identifier of <code>v1</code> and sets v1 as the policy's default version. For more information about policy versions, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html">Versioning for Managed Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information about managed policies in general, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed Policies and Inline Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

#### `createPolicyVersion`

``` purescript
createPolicyVersion :: forall eff. Service -> CreatePolicyVersionRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) CreatePolicyVersionResponse
```

<p>Creates a new version of the specified managed policy. To update a managed policy, you create a new policy version. A managed policy can have up to five versions. If the policy has five versions, you must delete an existing version using <a>DeletePolicyVersion</a> before you create a new version.</p> <p>Optionally, you can set the new version as the policy's default version. The default version is the version that is in effect for the IAM users, groups, and roles to which the policy is attached.</p> <p>For more information about managed policy versions, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html">Versioning for Managed Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

#### `createRole`

``` purescript
createRole :: forall eff. Service -> CreateRoleRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) CreateRoleResponse
```

<p>Creates a new role for your AWS account. For more information about roles, go to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithRoles.html">Working with Roles</a>. For information about limitations on role names and the number of roles you can create, go to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/LimitationsOnEntities.html">Limitations on IAM Entities</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

#### `createSAMLProvider`

``` purescript
createSAMLProvider :: forall eff. Service -> CreateSAMLProviderRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) CreateSAMLProviderResponse
```

<p>Creates an IAM resource that describes an identity provider (IdP) that supports SAML 2.0.</p> <p>The SAML provider resource that you create with this operation can be used as a principal in an IAM role's trust policy to enable federated users who sign-in using the SAML IdP to assume the role. You can create an IAM role that supports Web-based single sign-on (SSO) to the AWS Management Console or one that supports API access to AWS.</p> <p>When you create the SAML provider resource, you upload an a SAML metadata document that you get from your IdP and that includes the issuer's name, expiration information, and keys that can be used to validate the SAML authentication response (assertions) that the IdP sends. You must generate the metadata document using the identity management software that is used as your organization's IdP.</p> <note> <p> This operation requires <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4</a>.</p> </note> <p> For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-saml.html">Enabling SAML 2.0 Federated Users to Access the AWS Management Console</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html">About SAML 2.0-based Federation</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

#### `createServiceLinkedRole`

``` purescript
createServiceLinkedRole :: forall eff. Service -> CreateServiceLinkedRoleRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) CreateServiceLinkedRoleResponse
```

<p>Creates an IAM role that is linked to a specific AWS service. The service controls the attached policies and when the role can be deleted. This helps ensure that the service is not broken by an unexpectedly changed or deleted role, which could put your AWS resources into an unknown state. Allowing the service to control the role helps improve service stability and proper cleanup when a service and its role are no longer needed.</p> <p>The name of the role is autogenerated by combining the string that you specify for the <code>AWSServiceName</code> parameter with the string that you specify for the <code>CustomSuffix</code> parameter. The resulting name must be unique in your account or the request fails.</p> <p>To attach a policy to this service-linked role, you must make the request using the AWS service that depends on this role.</p>

#### `createServiceSpecificCredential`

``` purescript
createServiceSpecificCredential :: forall eff. Service -> CreateServiceSpecificCredentialRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) CreateServiceSpecificCredentialResponse
```

<p>Generates a set of credentials consisting of a user name and password that can be used to access the service specified in the request. These credentials are generated by IAM, and can be used only for the specified service. </p> <p>You can have a maximum of two sets of service-specific credentials for each supported service per user.</p> <p>The only supported service at this time is AWS CodeCommit.</p> <p>You can reset the password to a new service-generated value by calling <a>ResetServiceSpecificCredential</a>.</p> <p>For more information about service-specific credentials, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_ssh-keys.html">Using IAM with AWS CodeCommit: Git Credentials, SSH Keys, and AWS Access Keys</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

#### `createUser`

``` purescript
createUser :: forall eff. Service -> CreateUserRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) CreateUserResponse
```

<p>Creates a new IAM user for your AWS account.</p> <p> For information about limitations on the number of IAM users you can create, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/LimitationsOnEntities.html">Limitations on IAM Entities</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

#### `createVirtualMFADevice`

``` purescript
createVirtualMFADevice :: forall eff. Service -> CreateVirtualMFADeviceRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) CreateVirtualMFADeviceResponse
```

<p>Creates a new virtual MFA device for the AWS account. After creating the virtual MFA, use <a>EnableMFADevice</a> to attach the MFA device to an IAM user. For more information about creating and working with virtual MFA devices, go to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_VirtualMFA.html">Using a Virtual MFA Device</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For information about limits on the number of MFA devices you can create, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/LimitationsOnEntities.html">Limitations on Entities</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <important> <p>The seed information contained in the QR code and the Base32 string should be treated like any other secret access information, such as your AWS access keys or your passwords. After you provision your virtual device, you should ensure that the information is destroyed following secure procedures.</p> </important>

#### `deactivateMFADevice`

``` purescript
deactivateMFADevice :: forall eff. Service -> DeactivateMFADeviceRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Deactivates the specified MFA device and removes it from association with the user name for which it was originally enabled.</p> <p>For more information about creating and working with virtual MFA devices, go to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_VirtualMFA.html">Using a Virtual MFA Device</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

#### `deleteAccessKey`

``` purescript
deleteAccessKey :: forall eff. Service -> DeleteAccessKeyRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Deletes the access key pair associated with the specified IAM user.</p> <p>If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the AWS access key ID signing the request. Because this action works for access keys under the AWS account, you can use this action to manage root credentials even if the AWS account has no associated users.</p>

#### `deleteAccountAlias`

``` purescript
deleteAccountAlias :: forall eff. Service -> DeleteAccountAliasRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p> Deletes the specified AWS account alias. For information about using an AWS account alias, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/AccountAlias.html">Using an Alias for Your AWS Account ID</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

deleteGroupPolicy :: forall eff. Service -> DeleteGroupPolicyRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Deletes the specified inline policy that is embedded in the specified IAM group.</p> <p>A group can also have managed policies attached to it. To detach a managed policy from a group, use <a>DetachGroupPolicy</a>. For more information about policies, refer to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed Policies and Inline Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

#### `deleteInstanceProfile`

``` purescript
deleteInstanceProfile :: forall eff. Service -> DeleteInstanceProfileRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Deletes the specified instance profile. The instance profile must not have an associated role.</p> <important> <p>Make sure you do not have any Amazon EC2 instances running with the instance profile you are about to delete. Deleting a role or instance profile that is associated with a running instance will break any applications running on the instance.</p> </important> <p>For more information about instance profiles, go to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/AboutInstanceProfiles.html">About Instance Profiles</a>.</p>

#### `deleteLoginProfile`

``` purescript
deleteLoginProfile :: forall eff. Service -> DeleteLoginProfileRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Deletes the password for the specified IAM user, which terminates the user's ability to access AWS services through the AWS Management Console.</p> <important> <p> Deleting a user's password does not prevent a user from accessing AWS through the command line interface or the API. To prevent all user access you must also either make any access keys inactive or delete them. For more information about making keys inactive or deleting them, see <a>UpdateAccessKey</a> and <a>DeleteAccessKey</a>. </p> </important>

#### `deleteOpenIDConnectProvider`

``` purescript
deleteOpenIDConnectProvider :: forall eff. Service -> DeleteOpenIDConnectProviderRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Deletes an OpenID Connect identity provider (IdP) resource object in IAM.</p> <p>Deleting an IAM OIDC provider resource does not update any roles that reference the provider as a principal in their trust policies. Any attempt to assume a role that references a deleted provider fails.</p> <p>This action is idempotent; it does not fail or return an error if you call the action for a provider that does not exist.</p>

#### `deletePolicy`

``` purescript
deletePolicy :: forall eff. Service -> DeletePolicyRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Deletes the specified managed policy.</p> <p>Before you can delete a managed policy, you must first detach the policy from all users, groups, and roles that it is attached to, and you must delete all of the policy's versions. The following steps describe the process for deleting a managed policy:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Detach the policy from all users, groups, and roles that the policy is attached to, using the <a>DetachUserPolicy</a>, <a>DetachGroupPolicy</a>, or <a>DetachRolePolicy</a> APIs. To list all the users, groups, and roles that a policy is attached to, use <a>ListEntitiesForPolicy</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Delete all versions of the policy using <a>DeletePolicyVersion</a>. To list the policy's versions, use <a>ListPolicyVersions</a>. You cannot use <a>DeletePolicyVersion</a> to delete the version that is marked as the default version. You delete the policy's default version in the next step of the process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Delete the policy (this automatically deletes the policy's default version) using this API.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For information about managed policies, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed Policies and Inline Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

#### `deletePolicyVersion`

``` purescript
deletePolicyVersion :: forall eff. Service -> DeletePolicyVersionRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Deletes the specified version from the specified managed policy.</p> <p>You cannot delete the default version from a policy using this API. To delete the default version from a policy, use <a>DeletePolicy</a>. To find out which version of a policy is marked as the default version, use <a>ListPolicyVersions</a>.</p> <p>For information about versions for managed policies, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html">Versioning for Managed Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

#### `deleteRole`

``` purescript
deleteRole :: forall eff. Service -> DeleteRoleRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Deletes the specified role. The role must not have any policies attached. For more information about roles, go to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithRoles.html">Working with Roles</a>.</p> <important> <p>Make sure you do not have any Amazon EC2 instances running with the role you are about to delete. Deleting a role or instance profile that is associated with a running instance will break any applications running on the instance.</p> </important>

#### `deleteRolePolicy`

``` purescript
deleteRolePolicy :: forall eff. Service -> DeleteRolePolicyRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Deletes the specified inline policy that is embedded in the specified IAM role.</p> <p>A role can also have managed policies attached to it. To detach a managed policy from a role, use <a>DetachRolePolicy</a>. For more information about policies, refer to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed Policies and Inline Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

#### `deleteSAMLProvider`

``` purescript
deleteSAMLProvider :: forall eff. Service -> DeleteSAMLProviderRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Deletes a SAML provider resource in IAM.</p> <p>Deleting the provider resource from IAM does not update any roles that reference the SAML provider resource's ARN as a principal in their trust policies. Any attempt to assume a role that references a non-existent provider resource ARN fails.</p> <note> <p> This operation requires <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4</a>.</p> </note>

#### `deleteSSHPublicKey`

``` purescript
deleteSSHPublicKey :: forall eff. Service -> DeleteSSHPublicKeyRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Deletes the specified SSH public key.</p> <p>The SSH public key deleted by this action is used only for authenticating the associated IAM user to an AWS CodeCommit repository. For more information about using SSH keys to authenticate to an AWS CodeCommit repository, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-credentials-ssh.html">Set up AWS CodeCommit for SSH Connections</a> in the <i>AWS CodeCommit User Guide</i>.</p>

#### `deleteServerCertificate`

``` purescript
deleteServerCertificate :: forall eff. Service -> DeleteServerCertificateRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Deletes the specified server certificate.</p> <p>For more information about working with server certificates, including a list of AWS services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM, go to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html">Working with Server Certificates</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <important> <p> If you are using a server certificate with Elastic Load Balancing, deleting the certificate could have implications for your application. If Elastic Load Balancing doesn't detect the deletion of bound certificates, it may continue to use the certificates. This could cause Elastic Load Balancing to stop accepting traffic. We recommend that you remove the reference to the certificate from Elastic Load Balancing before using this command to delete the certificate. For more information, go to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteLoadBalancerListeners.html">DeleteLoadBalancerListeners</a> in the <i>Elastic Load Balancing API Reference</i>.</p> </important>

#### `deleteServiceLinkedRole`

``` purescript
deleteServiceLinkedRole :: forall eff. Service -> DeleteServiceLinkedRoleRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) DeleteServiceLinkedRoleResponse
```

<p>Submits a service-linked role deletion request and returns a <code>DeletionTaskId</code>, which you can use to check the status of the deletion. Before you call this operation, confirm that the role has no active sessions and that any resources used by the role in the linked service are deleted. If you call this operation more than once for the same service-linked role and an earlier deletion task is not complete, then the <code>DeletionTaskId</code> of the earlier request is returned.</p> <p>If you submit a deletion request for a service-linked role whose linked service is still accessing a resource, then the deletion task fails. If it fails, the <a>GetServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus</a> API operation returns the reason for the failure, including the resources that must be deleted. To delete the service-linked role, you must first remove those resources from the linked service and then submit the deletion request again. Resources are specific to the service that is linked to the role. For more information about removing resources from a service, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/">AWS documentation</a> for your service.</p> <p>For more information about service-linked roles, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role">Roles Terms and Concepts: AWS Service-Linked Role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

```

<p>Deletes the specified service-specific credential.</p>

#### `deleteSigningCertificate`

``` purescript
deleteSigningCertificate :: forall eff. Service -> DeleteSigningCertificateRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Deletes a signing certificate associated with the specified IAM user.</p> <p>If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the AWS access key ID signing the request. Because this action works for access keys under the AWS account, you can use this action to manage root credentials even if the AWS account has no associated IAM users.</p>

#### `deleteUser`

``` purescript
deleteUser :: forall eff. Service -> DeleteUserRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Deletes the specified IAM user. The user must not belong to any groups or have any access keys, signing certificates, or attached policies.</p>

``` purescript
simulateCustomPolicy :: forall eff. Service -> SimulateCustomPolicyRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) SimulatePolicyResponse
```

<p>Simulate how a set of IAM policies and optionally a resource-based policy works with a list of API actions and AWS resources to determine the policies' effective permissions. The policies are provided as strings.</p> <p>The simulation does not perform the API actions; it only checks the authorization to determine if the simulated policies allow or deny the actions.</p> <p>If you want to simulate existing policies attached to an IAM user, group, or role, use <a>SimulatePrincipalPolicy</a> instead.</p> <p>Context keys are variables maintained by AWS and its services that provide details about the context of an API query request. You can use the <code>Condition</code> element of an IAM policy to evaluate context keys. To get the list of context keys that the policies require for correct simulation, use <a>GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy</a>.</p> <p>If the output is long, you can use <code>MaxItems</code> and <code>Marker</code> parameters to paginate the results.</p>

#### `simulatePrincipalPolicy`

``` purescript
simulatePrincipalPolicy :: forall eff. Service -> SimulatePrincipalPolicyRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) SimulatePolicyResponse
```

<p>Simulate how a set of IAM policies attached to an IAM entity works with a list of API actions and AWS resources to determine the policies' effective permissions. The entity can be an IAM user, group, or role. If you specify a user, then the simulation also includes all of the policies that are attached to groups that the user belongs to .</p> <p>You can optionally include a list of one or more additional policies specified as strings to include in the simulation. If you want to simulate only policies specified as strings, use <a>SimulateCustomPolicy</a> instead.</p> <p>You can also optionally include one resource-based policy to be evaluated with each of the resources included in the simulation.</p> <p>The simulation does not perform the API actions, it only checks the authorization to determine if the simulated policies allow or deny the actions.</p> <p> <b>Note:</b> This API discloses information about the permissions granted to other users. If you do not want users to see other user's permissions, then consider allowing them to use <a>SimulateCustomPolicy</a> instead.</p> <p>Context keys are variables maintained by AWS and its services that provide details about the context of an API query request. You can use the <code>Condition</code> element of an IAM policy to evaluate context keys. To get the list of context keys that the policies require for correct simulation, use <a>GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy</a>.</p> <p>If the output is long, you can use the <code>MaxItems</code> and <code>Marker</code> parameters to paginate the results.</p>

#### `updateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint`

``` purescript
updateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint :: forall eff. Service -> UpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprintRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) NoOutput
```

<p>Replaces the existing list of server certificate thumbprints associated with an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource object with a new list of thumbprints.</p> <p>The list that you pass with this action completely replaces the existing list of thumbprints. (The lists are not merged.)</p> <p>Typically, you need to update a thumbprint only when the identity provider's certificate changes, which occurs rarely. However, if the provider's certificate <i>does</i> change, any attempt to assume an IAM role that specifies the OIDC provider as a principal fails until the certificate thumbprint is updated.</p> <note> <p>Because trust for the OIDC provider is ultimately derived from the provider's certificate and is validated by the thumbprint, it is a best practice to limit access to the <code>UpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint</code> action to highly-privileged users.</p> </note>
